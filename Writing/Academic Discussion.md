### Example 1

> In the previous lesson, we discussed the impact of changes in transportation modes on people's travel destination choices. Next week, we are going to look at other aspects related to ==people's travel preferences==. But first, I want to know what you think about this topic. So, here's a question for the class discussion board:
>
> **When it comes to traveling. Is it more advantageous to go alone or with a group?**
>
> Rachel: 
>
> I prefer to travel ==solo== because it allows me to have complete control over my ==itinerary==. I can go wherever I want, whenever I want, and stay for as long as I want. It can be a bit scary at first, but I think it's worth it for the freedom and flexibility.

>
> I prefer to travel in a group because it's more fun and I enjoy sharing the experience with others. It's also safer to travel in a group, especially if you're going to a place that you're not familiar with. I think it's important to have people to rely on and share the experience with.

#### Solution

1. What is the main topic of this discussion? 
2. What is the question raised by the professor?
3. What is the stand of ... ? How does she explain his/her idea?
4. Are there any other possible details or examples that can be added to support ...'s idea?

#### My Solution

I prefer to travel alone like Rachel. In addition to the flexibility, traveling alone saves time to discuss where and when to go with the group, needless to make compromises for others. Traveling itself is a relaxing thing, but when it comes to a team-working, it is somehow difficult to tackle.

> The reason why I wouldn't choose to go shopping on some local markets is that it takes a large amount of time.

I once traveled with a girl who likes handmade crafts, especially with shining parts decorated on them. We spent almost a whole day gambling around a local market in Guangzhou. To buy the best crafts, she went through the street almost four times, as she wanted to compare the prices and qualities of different crafts from different shops.

**top-down 先确定立场观点，再想例子解释**

I ==share Leonard's opinion==. It is undoubtedly crucial for us to ==stay informed about== global events. Let me ==reflect on my own experience as an example==. I made the mistake of investing in ==financial products== without adequately understanding the policies and political situations worldwide. As a result, I ==suffered financial losses== when the Russia-Ukraine conflict escalated. Had I taken the time to read analytical pieces and ==stay updated on international news==, I would have made wiser investment decisions and avoided such losses. Globalization enforces us to keep up with the latest news, or we may suffer losses and miss chances. The time spent to learn the world is quite worthy in this perspective.

<font color="red">特殊疑问句</font>

Communication technologies paced up humans' life and to some extent make modern people more and more anxious to some extent. For example, employees are required to respond to their bosses in instances even though they are off work or on vacation. It invisbly prolongs the working time of employees and adds more workload to them. They cannot get away from the supervision of the bosses and become more and more stressed. Though this kind of technology improved the efficiency of communication, it also negatively affected people's private lives, making them feel easily disturbed.

Communication technologies have accelerated the pace of human life, but they have also ==contributed to increasing levels of anxiety==. One example is the expectation for employees to be available and responsive to their bosses even outside of working hours or during vacations. This ==inadvertently extends== employees' working time and imposes an additional workload on them. Consequently, they are unable to escape the constant supervision of their superiors, leading to ==mounting stress levels==. While these technologies have undoubtedly enhanced communication efficiency, they have also had a ==detrimental impact== on individuals' personal lives, making them ==more susceptible to disruptions==.

I agree with Shylock's opinion, especially when he mentions the new sources of energy, such as **wind and solar power**. It is believed that **through** dedicated efforts to protect the environment, the ecological state of the world will definitely improve. Let me illustrate this with an example from China. In the past years, China faced significant problems with heavy haze. To address this issue, the government implemented several policies, such as restricting car usage based on license plate numbers and shutting down highly polluting factories. These measures have contributed to improving the environment. After years of hard work, the southern part of China hardly sees smog and other severe weather conditions. Therefore, if people continue to take action to mitigate the adverse effects that contribute to environmental degradation, the Earth can be clean and beautiful.

**Writing Practice Set 2: (Academic Discussion)** -- Response Tips 

To earn a top score, you should state and support your opinion about whether education or environmental protections should be the priority for governments to spend money on. Your response is a contribution to the other two students’ posts in an online discussion for the class. Be sure to ==add your own perspective to the discussion==, not merely repeat ideas that have already been stated. Typically, an effective response will contain a minimum of 100 words. 

You might agree with Kelly that environmental protections should be the priority. You will need to add your own support for this viewpoint. For example, you could argue that environmental protections are a more important investment to sustain our economies. You could point out that governments currently spend a great deal of money compensating for climate change catastrophes such as increased flooding, wind damage, or ruined crops. Investing more in environmental protections now could actually save governments money later on—which could then be used for more education funding. This would differ from the support Kelly gave for her opinion. 

If you agree with Andrew that education should be the bigger priority, you could add to his argument by pointing out the amount of research that universities conduct—not only on solving environmental problems, which Andrew alluded to, but also on treating diseases, creating useful technology, and developing sustainable agriculture. Therefore, education funding has a bigger overall impact on improving human lives than investment in environmental protections only. This would be a meaningful addition to the support Andrew provided for his opinion. 

You may find you agree with a point Kelly made about the environment even though you think education is more important. Or you might even find that your opinion about government priorities depends on certain factors—that education should be a priority in some circumstances, environmental protections in others. This is perfectly acceptable as long as you explain and support your reasoning. There is no “correct” answer to the question. The important part of this task is to make sure that you state your opinion and provide reasonable, relevant support for it in a way that makes a meaningful contribution to the online discussion. Try to develop your opinion as well as you can within the time limit. A well-developed response will contain clearly appropriate reasons, examples, and details—ones that do a good job supporting or illustrating your own viewpoint. 

The quality and accuracy of the sentence structure and vocabulary you use to express your ideas is also very important and part of what is considered when your response is scored. The task context—a post to an online discussion group—is not quite as informal as you might think. While the task asks you to contribute to a discussion with fellow students, imagine that the professor would also be reading your post. It is true that your tone might be more casual than what you would use in an academic paper, but you should still follow standard grammar rules. Also, if disagreeing with another student post, be sure to express your disagreement in a respectful way as you would in a real online discussion. 

This task is scored using the [Academic Discussion Rubric](https://www.ets.org/pdf/toefl/toefl-ibt-writing-rubrics-enhanced.pdf ).
