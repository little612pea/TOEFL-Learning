While the passage states that humpback whales are able to navigate themselves by using stars, the speaker in the lecture thinks it is not convincing of this statement for several reasons below.

Thirdly, the spy-hopping of humpback whales seems unrelated to star navigation. Other animals also exhibits spy-hopping behaviors but for the reasons other than orienting themselves by stars. The speaker takes shark as an example. Their spy-hopping behavior is not for the migration purpose but for hunting. Furthermore, whales act these behaviors in days when there are no stars to observe. Therefore, It can be inferred that spy-hopping has no link to the speculation of stars.





The reading passage proposes three theories to the function of carved stone balls dating from the late Neolithic period, all of which are questioned in the lecture.

The article ==proposes a hypothesis== that the stone balls were used as weapons, but the lecturer does not believe so. The speaker pointed out that if the balls were used for hunting and fights, there should have been cracked pieces as the fierce motions might tear the balls apart. However, so far, the discovered balls are all well-preserved, showing no signs of wear. Therefore, the stone balls cannot be weapons.

 

> The reading passage provides several theories about the function of carved stone balls found in Scotland, all of which are challenged in the lecture. 
>
> The first theory is that the stone balls were weapons with holes and grooves on the surface. On the contrary, the speaker believes it is unlikely to be true because weapons should have typical signs of wear, like cracks, but all the stones balls discovered were well-preserved and left no signs of wear on the surface. Therefore, the theory of stone balls being weapons doesn’t hold water. 
>
> Then the article provides a second theory that the stone balls could be part of weighing or measuring system since they were uniform in size. The speaker challenges this theory by adding a piece of additional information: although stone balls were uniform in size, their masses varied considerably due to various types of stones they were made from. Different density was the reason for their different weight, ruling out the hypothesis that the balls were used as weighing tools. 
>
> Finally, a third theory is also ruled out that the balls served social purposes. The speaker observed that while some balls have elaborate patterns on them, others bore very simple patterns. Another piece of evidence is that the stones weren’t found in graves of dead people, which contradicts with the customs in late Neolithic period that dead people, especially people in high social hierarchy, were buried with possessions. Therefore, the patterns on the balls couldn’t be the symbol of social status of their owners. 



The article presents three solutions to preserving frog population, all of which are questioned in the lecture.

The speaker in the lecture consider the first solution of prohibiting pesticides near sensitive frog populations in the passage economically unpractical and unfair to those farmers near frog habitats. Comparing to farmers who are not restricted to the use of pesticide, the farmers neighboring frog population will suffer a severe disadvantage. The lack of pesticide might contribute to the rise of harmful pests, resulting in the decrease of crop yield. As a result, farmers living near to frog habitat might earn less than those are not.

The lecturer does not believe the proposal that antifungal medication and treatments to be practical because this method must be applied to frog individually. To practicing this method, the staff have to capture, treat and then refree each frog, which is definitely a overloaded work. Furthermore, since the antifungal medication cannot be passed to frogs' offspring, the method might have to be practice over and over again for the new generations





Scientists are considering the possibility of sending humans to Mars in the coming decades. Although there have been successful manned missions to the Moon in the 1960s and 1970s, Mars is 150 times further away from Earth than the Moon is. Thus the project of sending humans to Mars would require solving an array of problems the Moon missions did not have to face. 

One problem is that a round-trip to Mars and back is likely to take at least two years. The trip to the Moon lasted only a few days, and it was easy to bring enough supplies of food, water, and oxygen; but the cargo capacity of space vehicles is too limited to put on board the food, water, and oxygen required by a crew for a period of two years. Without those essentials, though, a Mars mission is impossible. 

A second problem is that astronauts on the Mars mission would be in the zero-gravity environment of space for many months at a time. Spending a long time in the zero-gravity environment has negative effects on the human body, such as decreased muscle mass and lower bone density. Over the course of a two-year mission, the effects would be so severe, they would make it impossible for humans to make the trip without experiencing grave medical problems. 

Finally, astronauts on a mission to Mars would be exposed to dangerous levels of space radiation, much of which comes in the form of charged particles emitted by the Sun. Earth's magnetic field, which normally protects us from dangerous solar radiation, would not be able to protect a spaceship traveling in interplanetary space. Constructing a shield that would protect the whole spaceship from space radiation is at present impossible because it would add too much weight to the ship.

A trip to mars would definitely be challenging but scientists have proposed solutions to the problems the reading selection discusses.

First of all, food, water and oxygen. Well astronauts can use hydroponics. Hydroponics is a technique for growing plants with their roots in water rather than in soil. It requires relatively little space. Using hydroponics, the astronauts should be able to cultivate food crops in the spacecraft. In addition, the hydroponic will grow plants with recycle waste water and release it as clean water vapor, which can be collected as drinking water. And of course, all plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. So thanks to hydroponics the astronauts will also have fresh air to breathe.

Second, the effects of zero gravity. Over the last few decades, we have launched several space stations orbiting the earth. And a number of astronauts have spent many months on them in a zero gravity environment. These astronauts have learned to use several techniques to safely manage the effects of zero gravity. For example, regular exercise prevents the decrease in muscle mass. Likewise, taking vitamins and minerals like calcium slows down the decrease in astronauts’ bone density.

Third, solar radiation. Astronauts traveling to Mars will be exposed to some solar radiation but this radiation will not be at dangerous levels all the time. The sun only releases dangerous amounts of radiation occasionally, during periods when it is particularly active. In order to avoid this threat, the spacecraft could be equipped with special instruments that monitor solar radiation and with a small shelter that shield against radiation but doesn’t add much weight to the ship. Most of the time, the astronauts will go about their normal business in unshielded areas of the spacecraft. But when their instruments detect increased radiation, they could stay in the small shielded area until the danger has passed.
