> is it more challenging or easier for people to maintain good health today?

I have the same idea as Paul. Besides the increasing intendancy of adapting sedentary life, fast-progressed technology also creates more and more distractions for people, becoming blocks for them to lead a healthy life. For example, the convenience of take-out platforms online offers various choices for food, including junk food and other unhealthy criteria but shown in fabulous pictures which lure people to make unresponsible decisions for their health. They may rather choose a hamburger with attractive color indicating its delicious taste than salad and other healthier food. And it is the same to be applied in other situations in real life, such as watching a movie instead of taking a walk. Therefore, it can be illustrated that without solid determination, ones can hardly get out of the traps set by companies' complex strategies. In short, the abundant disturbance nowadays makes it harder for people to keep healthy.

I share the same perspective as Paul. In addition to ==the growing inclination== towards a sedentary lifestyle, rapid advancements in technology have introduced numerous distractions that ==hinder people from== leading healthy life. For instance, online food delivery platforms provide ==a wide range of choices==, including unhealthy and junk food options, presented in enticing pictures that tempt individuals to make irresponsible decisions concerning their health. People might opt for a visually appealing hamburger that suggests deliciousness, rather than choosing a salad or other healthier alternatives. ==This phenomenon extends beyond food choices and can be observed in various real-life situations==, such as preferring to watch a movie instead of going for a walk. Consequently, it becomes evident that without strong determination, ==individuals find it challenging to escape the traps set by companies employing complex strategies==. In summary, ==the abundance of distractions== in today's world makes it increasingly difficult for people to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

I stand by Claire. I would like to add one contributing factor: breakthroughs of medical technology are also helping modern people successfully treat serious or even rare disease previously considered impossible to be cured in the past. Vaccines come to my mind. As far as I know, in most of the countries in the world, newborn babies get injected with vaccines of infectious diseases, like smallpox, chickenpox, tuberculosis, or malaria. These vaccines greatly reduced their chances of being infected with these detrimental illnesses when they grow up, keeping them in better health conditions. In comparison, it was reported that decades ago, death rate of new born babies was several times higher than it is now. I believe the wider spread and more affordability of vaccines must be one of the reasons behind it.
