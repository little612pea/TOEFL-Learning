> is it more challenging or easier for people to maintain good health today?

I have the same idea as Paul. Besides the increasing intendancy of adapting sedentary life, fast-progressed technology also creates more and more distractions for people, becoming blocks for them to lead a healthy life. For example, the convenience of take-out platforms online offers various choices for food, including junk food and other unhealthy criteria but shown in fabulous pictures which lure people to make unresponsible decisions for their health. They may rather choose a hamburger with attractive color indicating its delicious taste than salad and other healthier food. And it is the same to be applied in other situations in real life, such as watching a movie instead of taking a walk. Therefore, it can be illustrated that without solid determination, ones can hardly get out of the traps set by companies' complex strategies. In short, the abundant disturbance nowadays makes it harder for people to keep healthy.

I share the same perspective as Paul. In addition to ==the growing inclination== towards a sedentary lifestyle, rapid advancements in technology have introduced numerous distractions that ==hinder people from== leading healthy life. For instance, online food delivery platforms provide ==a wide range of choices==, including unhealthy and junk food options, presented in enticing pictures that tempt individuals to make irresponsible decisions concerning their health. People might opt for a visually appealing hamburger that suggests deliciousness, rather than choosing a salad or other healthier alternatives. ==This phenomenon extends beyond food choices and can be observed in various real-life situations==, such as preferring to watch a movie instead of going for a walk. Consequently, it becomes evident that without strong determination, ==individuals find it challenging to escape the traps set by companies employing complex strategies==. In summary, ==the abundance of distractions== in today's world makes it increasingly difficult for people to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

I stand by Claire. I would like to add one contributing factor: breakthroughs of medical technology are also helping modern people successfully treat serious or even rare disease previously considered impossible to be cured in the past. Vaccines come to my mind. As far as I know, in most of the countries in the world, newborn babies get injected with vaccines of infectious diseases, like smallpox, chickenpox, tuberculosis, or malaria. These vaccines greatly reduced their chances of being infected with these detrimental illnesses when they grow up, keeping them in better health conditions. In comparison, it was reported that decades ago, death rate of new born babies was several times higher than it is now. I believe the wider spread and more affordability of vaccines must be one of the reasons behind it.

I partially agree with Justin's opinion when he mentions the low efficiency of field trips. However, I believe the unique experiences are worth taking the time, and their advantages outweigh the drawbacks. Field trips immerse pupils in a certain atmosphere and offer them special learning experiences that quite differ from ==traditional classroom settings==. These experiences can be highly ==engaging and memorable==, enhancing the ==educational process==. For example, children can go to china studios to learn about the development of china <font color="red">*instead of a regular art class in the classroom*</font>. Through creating and painting the china in hand, they obtain the interest of crafting things and get aesthetic improvement. Due to the comparatively small size, the lack of equipment and other limitations, it is relatively hard for them to do the work in the classroom. Not only do the students learn ==the intricate process== of china making, but they also learn the ==wisdom and dedication== of their ancestors who created the china. What's more field trips offer chances for pupils to practice the knowledge learned from classes and apply it ==in real-world situations==, which is definitely good for their growth. Therefore, field trips can be ==a valuable component of a well-rounded education.==

<font color="red"> instead of是修饰语，修饰成分要就近与被修饰成分。这么写读起来像development of china instead of a regular art class。这里可以改成children can learn about the development of china during a visit to china studios instead of by attending a regular art class. </font>

In conclusion, field trips offer unique educational experiences that ==go beyond the confines of the classroom==. 

They provide opportunities for ==hands-on learning, engagement with real-world contexts, and the application of knowledge==. While there may be some logistical challenges and limitations, the benefits of field trips outweigh the drawbacks, making them a valuable component of a well-rounded education.

Sara's opinion aligns with mine. Not only do the chances of being admitted increase when introduced by an acquaintance, but the credibility of the job quality is also comparatively high. Friends or relatives who introduce job opportunities may have ==personal insights into the position they recommend==, knowing the future prospects and other important information that is rarely known by outsiders. For example, I had the opportunity to secure an internship through my father's friend who works in the semiconductor industry. Given his years of experience in the field, <font color="red">he provided me with valuable guidance</font> and shared knowledge about the industry. During the three-month internship, I gained a deep understanding of the industry and learned a great deal from the experience. Furthermore, acquaintances who know you well are more likely to recommend job opportunities that are suitable for your skills and aspirations. They have a better understanding of your strengths and can suggest positions that align with your career goals, ensuring that your job search is more targeted and satisfying. In conclusion, leveraging personal connections can significantly enhance job search outcomes.
