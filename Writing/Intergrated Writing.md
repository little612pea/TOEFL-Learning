The lecture explained **why the computerized voting system can not replace the traditional voting system**. Here are the following three reasons. 

First of all, **not everyoen one can use computers correctly**. Some people do not have access to computers, some people are not used of computers, and some people are even scared of this new technology. If the voters do not know how to use a computer, how do you expect them to finish the voting process through computers? <font color="darkblue">==This directly refutes== the reading passage which states that computerized voting is easier by just touchingthe screen. </font>

Secondly, computers **may make mistakes** as the people do. As computers are programmed by the human beings, thus erros are inevitable in the computer system. Problems caused by computer voting systems may be more serious than those caused by people. A larger number of votes might be miss counted or even removed from the system. Furthermore, it would take more energy to recount the votes.  <font color="darkblue">==Again this contradicts== what is stated in the reading which stated that only people will make mistakes in counting.  </font>

Thirdly, computerized voting system is not reliable because **it has not reached a stable status**. People trust computers to conduct banking transactions because the computerized banking system is being used daily and frecuently and has been stable. How ever, the voting does not happen as often as banking thus the computerized voting system has not been proved to be totally reliable. 

All in all, not everyone can use a computer properly, computer cause mistakes and computerized voting system is not reliable are the main reasons why computerized voting system can not replace the traditional voting system.

The reading passage and the lecture both address the impact of climate change on polar bears, but they present different viewpoints on the severity of the situation.

According to the reading passage, the decline in Arctic sea ice caused by global warming has had a detrimental effect on polar bears' survival. The shrinking ice has resulted in reduced access to food sources, such as seals, which are crucial for their sustenance. Additionally, polar bears are now forced to travel longer distances to find food, leading to increased energy expenditure and an elevated risk of mortality. Consequently, the reading passage suggests that climate change poses a significant threat to the polar bear population.

On the other hand, the lecture challenges the pessimistic outlook presented in the reading passage. The professor highlights recent research indicating that some polar bear populations have shown adaptability to the changing conditions. These bears have adjusted their hunting patterns and diet to cope with the decreasing availability of seals, thus increasing their chances of survival. Furthermore, the lecture emphasizes that conservation efforts have yielded positive outcomes in certain regions, leading to stable or growing polar bear populations. These findings suggest that polar bears might be more resilient in the face of climate change than initially believed.

In conclusion, while the reading passage asserts that climate change has had a devastating impact on polar bears, the lecture provides evidence of the species' adaptability and successful conservation efforts in certain areas. The issue remains complex, and further research is necessary to fully understand the implications of climate change on polar bear populations worldwide.
