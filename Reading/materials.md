### Symbiotic Relationships

A symbiotic relationship is an interaction between two or more species in which one species lives in or on another species. There are three main types of symbiotic relationships: parasitism, commensalism, and mutualism. The first and the third can be key factors in the structure of a biological community; that is, all the populations of organisms living together and potentially interacting in a particular area.

Parasitism is a kind of predator-prey relationship in which one organism, the parasite, derives its food at the expense of its symbiotic associate, the host. Parasites are usually smaller than their hosts. An example of a parasite is a tapeworm that lives inside the intestines of a larger animal and absorbs nutrients from its host. 【Natural selection】【 the process that results in the survival of individuals or groups 【best adjusted to the conditions 【under which they live】】】 favors 【the parasites that are best able to find and feed on hosts】. At the same time, defensive abilities of hosts are also selected for. As an example, plants make chemicals toxic to ==fungal== and bacterial parasites, along with ones toxic to predatory animals (sometimes they are the same chemicals). In vertebrates, the immune system provides a multiple defense against internal parasites.

At times, it is actually possible to watch ==the effects of natural selection in host-parasite relationships==. For example, Australia during the 1940’s was overrun by hundreds of millions of European rabbits. The rabbits destroyed huge expanses of Australia and threatened the sheep and cattle industries. In 1950, myxoma virus, a parasite that affects rabbits, was deliberately introduced into Australia to control the rabbit population. Spread rapidly by mosquitoes, the virus devastated the rabbit population. The virus was less deadly to the offspring of surviving rabbits, however, and it caused less and less harm over the years. Apparently, genotypes (the genetic make-up of an organism) in the rabbit population were selected that were better able to resist the parasite. Meanwhile, the deadliest strains of the virus perished with their hosts a s natural selection favored strains that could infect hosts but not kill them. Thus, natural selection stabilized this host-parasite relationship.

In contrast to parasitism, in commensalism, one partner benefits without significantly affecting the other. Few cases of absolute commensalism probably exist, because it is unlikely that one of the partners will be completely unaffected. Commensal associations sometimes involve one species’ obtaining food that is inadvertently exposed by another. For instance, several kinds of birds feed on insects flushed out of the grass by grazing cattle. It is difficult to imagine how this could affect the cattle, but the relationship may help or hinder them in some way not yet recognized.

The third type of symbiosis, mutualism, benefits both partners in the relationship. Legume plants and their nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and the interactions between flowering plants and their pollinators, are examples of mutualistic association. //In the first case, the plants provide the bacteria with carbohydrates and other organic compounds, and the bacteria have enzymes that act as catalysts that eventually add nitrogen to the soil, enriching it.// In the second case, pollinators (insects, birds) obtain food from the flowering plant, and the plant has its pollen distributed and seeds dispersed much more efficiently than they would be if they were carried by the wind only.// Another example of mutualism would be the bull’s horn acacia tree, which grows in Central and South America. The tree provides a place to live for ants of the genus Pseudomyrmex. The ants live in large, hollow thorns and eat sugar secreted by the tree. The ants also eat yellow structures at the tip of leaflets; these are protein rich and seem to have no function for the tree except to attract ants. The ants benefit the host tree by attacking virtually anything that touches it. They sting other insects and large herbivores (animals that eat only plants) and even clip surrounding vegetation that grows near the tree. When the ants are removed, the trees usually die, probably because herbivores damage them so much that they are unable to compete with surrounding vegetation for light and growing space. 



The complex interplay of species in symbiotic relationships highlights an important point about communities: Their structure depends on a web of diverse connections among organisms.

**Insect Wings** 

##### Paragraph 1 

The power of flight is a major chapter in the success story of insects. Because insects with developed wings appear relatively suddenly in the fossil record and there are no good fossils that show intermediate stages, there is a great deal of speculation as to how wings might have evolved. 

 

##### Paragraph 2 

Insects are different from other flying creatures like birds and bats, which evolved wings from already existing legs, and one of the main questions is what the first protowings (early forms of wings) were used for. One view is that outgrowths from the notum (upper portion) of the thorax (middle region of the body between the head and the abdomen) would have enabled insects to have a more stable and longer glide path (movement through the air without using wings). This paranotal theory envisages early insects climbing plants and launching themselves into the air as a more efficient, and perhaps safer, means of getting around or avoiding predators. These protowings might have had other functions, and experimental evidence suggests that when small, they would have had a significant role in the regulation of body temperature. Other ideas have involved small insects being carried around in air currents or larger insects jumping from the ground and taking to the air. 

 

1. According to paragraph 2. one benefit of the outgrowths from an insect’s thorax might have been to C

A. allow the insect to sense the presence of predators 

B. prevent the insect from being carried away by air currents 

C. allow the insect to glide through the air for a longer distance 

D. aid the insect in climbing up plants 

 

##### Paragraph 3 

There is a major problem with ideas that involve paranotal protowings and gliding, which is that, at some time, these fixed structures needed to have become hinged (connected in a way that allows on structure to swing relative to the other) and to have developed muscle systems to make them flap up and down. It is much easier to imagine structures that were already hinged and muscled in fulfilling some prior function and then eventually taking on a role in flight. The endite-exite theory suggests that protowings developed from the fusion of inner and outer appendages (endites and exites) of short leg segments, which were already hinged and might have been under some sort of muscular control. 

 

2. The word “fulfilling” in the passage is closest in meaning to A

A. performing 

B. developing 

C. replacing 

D. combining with 

##### Paragraph 4 

An additional convincing argument in support of the theory that wings developed from leg appendages, and that further disputes the paranotal theory, comes from the occurrence and distribution of sensory receptors on the wings of today’s insects. Chemical-sensing organs are not found on the surface of the thorax but are typical of legs. Furthermore, specialized receptors called campaniform sensilla that are found on wings and react to stresses and strains are only ever found on appendages, not body segments. 

 

3. Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 3 or 4 as being a problem with the paranotal theory of insect-wing evolution? 

A. Wings require hinged structures. 

B. Insects of today have sensory receptors on their wings. 

C. Wings developed at the thorax could not have supported an insect’s weight while gliding. 

D. Wing flapping requires a system of muscle control. 

 

4. In paragraph 4, why does the author mention that campaniform sensilla are “only ever found on appendages, not body segments”? 

A. To identify a chemical-sensing organ that is not found on the thorax of an insect 

B. To provide more evidence for the theory that wings evolved from legs

C. To argue that wings may have evolved as organs for the sense of smell 

D. To explain how insects use wings to avoid stresses and strains 

 

##### Paragraph 5 

Another theory is that wings may have been derived from flap-like gills (organs allowing breathing under water) in immature aquatic insects that might have been retained in the adults for reasons other than movement, such as regulation of body temperature, concealment, and signaling. Aquatic insects, such as the ancient mayflies, use their tracheal gills not just for breathing but also for movement. What then might be the link between movement through water and flying? A novel insight has been provided by the sailing or surface-skimming behavior seen in some stoneflies. Using their wings either as static sails to catch gusts of wind or by gentle flapping, these insects are able to propel themselves across the water’s surface to reach stones and vegetation. Perhaps the early protowings were gill flaps or gill covers that were used by such insects to move through water, but could also have been of use to the adult in surface skimming. Gradual development of larger muscles would have allowed stronger and stronger flapping and led ultimately to true flight. 

 

5. Why does the author discuss the behavior of “some stoneflies”? 

A. To suggest how the gills of aquatic insects might have evolved into wings capable of flight 

B. To show that some insects are able to use their wings for purposes other than flight 

C. To give an example of an insect that has developed muscles for flapping its wings 

D. To contrast the use of gills in stoneflies with the use of gills in ancient mayflies 

 

6. According to paragraph 5, what could have been the final development that enabled aquatic insects to fly? 

A. Larger muscles 

B. Hinged gill flaps 

C. Larger gill covers 

D. Sail-shaped wings 

 

##### Paragraph 6 

Flight certainly allowed insects to disperse, to colonize new habitats, and to escape from their enemies. Which of these might have been of primary significance in the evolution of wings is a matter of debate, but predator avoidance is an excellent candidate as it is clear that life in the Paleozoic (540 to 230 million years ago) was dangerous due to the numbers of predators. Preeminent among predator-avoidance mechanisms must have been increasingly sophisticated early-warning systems composed of delicate vibration- or wind-sensing hairs. These systems elicit an escape response of running or jumping. It has been suggested that this escape response, the development of protowings, and a gradual rewiring of nerves in the thorax and abdomen might have been the route by which insects achieved powered flight so quickly. 

 

7. Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information. 

A.   Debate over the purpose of wing evolution in insects has ended with the conclusion that wings evolved as a means to avoid predators. 

B.   Whether wing evolution in insects was significant for insect safety in the Paleozoic is a matter of debate. 

C.   Predator avoidance was difficult for insects during the Paleozoic because wings did not evolve until about 230 million years ago. 

D.   Wings might have evolved mainly as a means to avoid the many predators that endangered insects during the Paleozoic. 

 

8. What can be inferred from paragraph 6 about how an early insect learned that a predator was near? A. Wind would carry the predator’s smell to sensory receptors on the insect. 

B. A predator’s approach would cause a response in specialized hairs on the insect. 

C. An insect’s protowing would vibrate when a predator was close. 

D. Nerve impulses would pass between the thorax and abdomen when a predator was near.
