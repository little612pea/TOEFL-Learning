### TPO35 R2 **The Development of Social Complexity**

1. For most of human history, we have foraged (hunted, fished, and collected wild plants) for food. Small nomadic groups could easily supply the necessities for their families. No one needed more, and providing for more than one’s needs made little sense. The organization of such societies could be rather simple, **revolving around age and gender categories[A]**. Such societies likely were **largely egalitarian[D]**; beyond distinctions based on age and gender, virtually all people had equivalent rights, status, and **access to resources[B].**

   

   Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 1 as a characteristic of early nomadic foraging societies?

   A. Organization by age or gender

   B. Collection of surplus food

   C. Equal access to resources

   D. Lack of status divisions

2. Archaeologist Donald Henry suggests that the combination of a rich habitat and sedentism (permanent, year-round settlement) led to a dramatic increase in human population. In his view, nomadic, simple foragers have relatively low levels of fertility. Their high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets result in low body-fat levels, which are commonly associated with **low fertility** in women. High levels of physical activity and long periods of nursing, which are common among ***modern simple foragers***, probably also contributed to low levels of female fertility if they were likewise common among ancient foragers.

   考古学家唐纳德·亨利认为，丰富的栖息地和定居（永久性的全年定居点）的结合导致了人口急剧增加。在他看来，游牧、简单的觅食者的生育率相对较低。他们的高蛋白、低碳水化合物的饮食导致身体脂肪水平低，这通常与女性低生育能力有关。高水平的体育活动和长时间的喂奶在现代简单觅食者中很常见，如果它们在古代觅食者中也同样常见，那么它们可能也导致女性生育率低。

   Why does the author mention “modern simple foragers”?

   A. To contrast the diets of modern simple foragers with those of ancient simple foragers

   B. To illustrate the effects of low levels of female fertility on foraging populations

   C. To help support the claim that ancient foragers may have had low levels of fertility

   D. To argue for a link between nursing practices and fertility levels

3. All of these factors may have resulted in a trend of increasing size among some local human populations in the Holocene (since 9600 B.C.E). ◼️Given sufficient time, even in very rich habitats, human population size can reach carrying capacity, the maximum population an area can sustain within the context of a given subsistence system. ◼️And human population growth is like a runaway train: once it picks up speed, it is difficult to control. ◼️So even after reaching an area’s carrying capacity, Holocene human populations probably continued to grow in food-rich regions, overshooting the ability of the territory to feed the population, again within the context of the same subsistence strategy. ◼️In some areas, small changes in climate or minor changes in plant characteristics may have further destabilized local economies.

   

   Population growth eventually leads to potential problems, however.

1. The diffusion of agriculture and later of iron was accompanied by a great movement of people who may have carried these innovations. These people probably originated in eastern Nigeria. Their migration may have been set in motion by an **increase in population[D]** caused by a movement of people fleeing the desiccation, or drying up, of the Sahara. They spoke a language, proto-Bantu (“bantu” means “the people”), which is the parent tongue of a large number of Bantu languages still spoken throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Why and how these people spread out into central and southern Africa remains a mystery, but archaeologists believe that their **iron weapons[A]** allowed them to conquer their hunting-gathering opponents, who still used stone implements. Still, the process is uncertain, and **peaceful migration[C]**—or **simply rapid demographic(人口的)[D]** growth—may have also caused the Bantu explosion.

   

   Paragraph 6 mentions all of the following as possible causes of the “Bantu explosion” EXCEPT

   A. superior weapons

   B. better hunting skills

   C. peaceful migration

   D. increased population
