##### electronic devices

> expose children to electronic devices

I think children should be allowed to use digital devices. that's because children can learn a lot from the devices.

They can learn knowledge from e-resources like calculating and vocabulary.

and experience the world with phones and laptops, like video games and documentaries. This immersive experience can teach them knowledge while playing with them. They will indeed believe it is a wonderful journey through the media.

As children sitting still before the screen, parents or others who takes care of them might have a break, relieve them from the heavy load on them.
